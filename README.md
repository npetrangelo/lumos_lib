# lumos_lib
A Rust port of my dad's [Lumos library](https://github.com/john-petrangelo/lumos-arduino), originally written in C++.

This repository also contains an app binary to play with the Lumos library without an Arduino with an LED strip.

To run the app, simply run `cargo run` on the outer project.
